# r2r_airbnb

Trip planner using Airbnb, Rome2Rio, Foursquare, Google Maps and Flask.

# What it does:

* Searches for Airbnb listings based on location input
* Gives average price for city then allows user to search within a price range
* Returns top-rated Airbnb listings within specified parameters
* Plots results onto a Google Maps map with info windows showing price per night, average rating, number of reviews
* Searches for recommended Foursquare venues surrounding chosen Airbnb and plots them on another Google Map

# What it will do in the future:

* Search Rome2Rio for directions (eg. flights) from user-specified home address to Airbnb address
* Allow user to add another 'stop' before returning home
* Add custom marker icons for different Foursquare venues - eg 'restaurant', 'coffee', 'bar'
* Add custom marker icons for different Airbnb types - 'entire apartment', 'private room', 'shared room'
* Look nicer - Add Bootstrap / other framework styling
